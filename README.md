# Face-Recognition-Using-CNN
I have done a small project of face recognition using CNN. The CNN algorithm has a great accuracy rate, so the face recognition code is made by the CNN prediction method. So I created the face data by recording the videos and videos are converted into images. From the images, the face is extracted and stored by name of the person in a particular folder in google drive. then the data is reducing the proper memory size because of limited GPU access. All the data is appended into x and y and then is divided into x and y, train, test, and accuracy. The data is fed to the CNN algorithm code and the result was around 0.9154. A confusion matrix was used for the result and it was perfect as expected. the model was saved and download. the model was tested using openCV2 and it was able to detect the face and given the name of the person.
